                        <h4>Drones a 'game changer' for rescue teams</h4>
                        <p>
                            Drones have a growing role in the work of Scottish mountain rescue teams, 
                            says Search and Rescue Aerial Association (Scotland). Today there are
                            19 pilots and 21 drones across nine Scottish Mountain Rescue-member
                            teams. There were none four years ago. Chairman Tom Nash of SARAA 
                            Scotland, said in a short number of years drone technology had 
                            developed from use in daytime only to having zoom-capable cameras,
                            thermal imaging and floodlights for night-time missions.

                        <h4>Incandescent Light Bulbs to Be Phased Out in 2023</h4>
                        <p>
                            The end of an era is coming for incandescent light bulbs. 
                            The Department of Energy put two new rules on the books 
                            this week banning the production of these energy-sucking 
                            light sources in 2023, at which time manufacturers will be 
                            able to sell only energy-efficient light bulbs. The Energy Department 
                            said that once the rules take effect in 2023, consumers will collectively 
                            save close to $3 billion per year on utility bills. The planet will also benefit,
                            the agency notes, as carbon emissions will be slashed by 222 million metric
                            tons over the next 30 years. That's equal to the emissions produced by 28 
                            million homes in a year.

                        <h4>Stolen fingerprints could spell the end of biometric security</h4>
                        <p>
                            The biggest known biometric data breach to date was reported recently
                            when researchers managed to access a 23-gigabyte database 
                            of more than 27.8m records including fingerprint and facial recognition 
                            data. This breach highlights a major problem with biometric security 
                            systems that effectively use people's biological measurements as
                            passwords. Unlike usernames and passwords, biometric data can't be 
                            changed if it is stolen.
